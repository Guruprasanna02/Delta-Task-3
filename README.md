# Poll Booth
Vikram and Pavithra want to decide upon a design for Delta T Shirt. They decided to put up a poll among Delta members to select a design. So they asked their juniors to develop a portal which facilitates polling among teams.

They need a website which allows creation of teams and polls within the team members built upon a full fledged frontend and backend.
